# Monitored database of electricity consumption and thermal comfort in households

The current webpage provides the database of measurements regarding electricity consumption and thermal comfort in households located in Heraklion, Greece. The monitoring campaign took place in the framework of the participative initiative called “Municipality transition towards low-carbon economy through citizen participative procedures” coordinated by the Municipality of Heraklion. The action envisages energy inspections to households and provision of personalized recommendations on energy-upgrading solutions. It was launched during the Energy-days event in September 2019 (refer to the url: https://www.heraklion.gr/municipality/press-releases-2019/hmeres-energeias-200919.html) in terms of an open call to citizens to declare their participation. Out of the 200 residences so far participated, 8 residences took advantage of the cost-free option (provided by the initiative) to install low-intrusive measuring devices with a feedback service in order to better understand their energy performance and indoor environmental conditions and in order to promote awareness raising towards energy-behaviour shift. The current database refers to 4 residences in the winter period (end October 2021 to March 2022) and 4 different ones in the summer period (June to September 2023).

Monitoring system installed: (a) Wibeee One meter of Smilics Technologies for total electricity consumption (adjusted in the power cut-off relay in the central electrical panel); (b) Yowexa YMUP-20D PDF Temperature and Humidity Data Logger (placed at the living-room), for indoor air temperature and relative humidity (RH).

Data processing for thermal comfort: The indoor air conditions measured are converted to the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) index.

Meteorological data during measurements: Hourly climatic data are retrieved from the National Observatory of Athens and specifically from the weather station located at the east part of Heraklion (only 3 km far from the city centre) (refer to the url: http://penteli.meteo.gr/stations/heraclioneast/).

Limitations: Since the electricity meter used is Wi-Fi-dependent in situations of internet interruption or corruption of meter syncing configuration, data are not transmitted and the measurements are lost. In the current campaign, such instances led to quite long periods of missing data as the access to each residence for repairing was not very easy (considering the voluntary nature of homeowners’ participation).
